# freecad-python-code: Code examples for Freecad Application
Example 1: TransferTinesToPallet for animating / Simulating Pick & Place of Parts into container/cavities (Pallet)
The code was developed to showcase two automated pick & place processes where 
1) Process 1: Parts are conveyed to left and right side of a 48-cavities pallet. Two sets of XYZ sliders each with single part 
   gripper will pick up parts and place them into cavities of the pallet. The filled pallet will be rotated to another location for process 2.
2) Process 2: Another robotic arm with 6-grippers end effector will pick 6 parts in one action and place them onto another
   sub-assembly
